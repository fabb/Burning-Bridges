# BurningBridges

Demonstrates a few problems that happen with the Swift 3 migrator and bridge in Xcode 8

## Trigger Migration

This project is a mixed ObjC/Swift project generated with Xcode 7. When opening in Xcode 8 (beta), the automatic Swift 3 migrator results in a few issues.

The problematic cases are demonstrated in the file [Problematic.swift](BurningBridges/Problematic/Problematic.swift).

## Participating

Once complete, a radar will be filed with Apple, including a reference to this project.

If you have additional problematic cases, you are welcome to make a pull request to this repo.
